# ESL-ESP 
to Enjoy, Share, Learn, and Practice ESL _(English as a Second Language)_ & ESP _(English for Specific Purposes)_

A place to share **material for and by my students**, future professionals of: 
- **_Digital Humanities_** (esp. Edtech branch)
- **_Cultural & Intercultural Project Management_**
- and maybe other subjects in Humanities too...

In a world where _tech giants_ seem to be everywhere, I find it quite refreshing to use this free open source... and experimental solution: thank you, Scribouilli! And now, let the adventure begin!
