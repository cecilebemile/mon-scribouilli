# ESL-ESP is a website to _Enjoy, Share, Learn, and Practice_ ESL (English as a Second Language) and ESP (English for Specific Purposes)

It is a place to share **material for and by my students**, future professionals of: 
- Cultural & Intercultural Project Management
- Digital Humanities (esp. Edtech)
- and maybe other subjects in Humanities too...

In a world where Tech Giants seem to be everywhere, I find it quite refreshing to use this free open source... and experimental solution: thank you, Scribouilli! And now, let the adventure begin!
