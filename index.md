# ESL-ESP 
to Enjoy, Share, Learn, and Practice ESL _(English as a Second Language)_ & ESP _(English for Specific Purposes)_

**Material & links for and by my students**, future professionals of: 
- **_Digital Humanities_** (esp. Edtech branch)
- **_Cultural & Intercultural Project Management_**
- and maybe other subjects in Humanities too...

_In a world where tech giants seem to be everywhere, I find it quite refreshing to use this free open source... and experimental solution: thank you, Scribouilli & Github!_ 
And now, let the adventure begin!
