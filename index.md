# ESL-ESP 
to Enjoy, Share, Learn, and Practice ESL (_English as a Second Language_) & ESP (_English for Specific Purpose_s)

A place to share **material for and by my students**, future professionals of: 
- Digital Humanities (esp. Edtech)
- Cultural & Intercultural Project Management
- and maybe other subjects in Humanities too...

In a world where Tech Giants seem to be everywhere, I find it quite refreshing to use this free open source... and experimental solution: thank you, Scribouilli! And now, let the adventure begin!
